## Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# Start from ubuntu:24.04
FROM ubuntu:24.04

# Install curl
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Copy the script file
COPY script.sh .

# Make the script executable
RUN chmod +x script.sh

# Set the script to run on container start
CMD ["./script.sh"]
```

## Building the Image

Create the `script.sh` file with the following contents:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
while true
do
  echo "Input website:"
  read website; echo "Searching.."
  sleep 1; curl http://$website
done
```

Then build the image:

```bash
docker build -t curler .
```

## Running the Image

```bash
docker run -it curler
```

Input a website (e.g., `helsinki.fi`) and the script will fetch and display the HTML content.

## Key Dockerfile Instructions Used

- **FROM** - Specifies the base image (ubuntu:24.04)
- **RUN** - Executes commands during build time (install curl, set permissions)
- **COPY** - Copies the script file from host to container
- **CMD** - Sets the default command to run when container starts

## Explanation

The Dockerfile:
1. Uses Ubuntu 24.04 as the base image
2. Updates package lists and installs curl
3. Cleans up the apt cache to keep the image smaller (`rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*`)
4. Copies the script.sh file into the container
5. Makes the script executable with chmod +x
6. Sets the script to run automatically when the container starts with CMD
