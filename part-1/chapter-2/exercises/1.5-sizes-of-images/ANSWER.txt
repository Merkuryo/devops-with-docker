## Image Sizes Comparison

### Pull both images:
```bash
docker pull devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:ubuntu
docker pull devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:alpine
```

### Compare sizes:
```bash
docker image ls | grep "simple-web-service"
```

## Results

**Alpine image size:** 15.7 MB

**Ubuntu image size:** 83 MB

Alpine is approximately 5 times smaller than Ubuntu.

## Verification of Secret Message in Alpine

Alpine Linux doesn't have bash, but it has sh (shell). The secret message functionality is identical in both versions.

### Access the Alpine container:
```bash
docker run -d --name simple-web-alpine devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:alpine
docker exec simple-web-alpine cat ./text.log | grep "Secret"
```

### Output:
```
Secret message is: 'You can find the source code here: https://github.com/docker-hy'
```

The secret message appears every 10 seconds in the Alpine version, just like in the Ubuntu version, confirming that the application functionality is identical despite the significant size difference.

## Key Takeaways

- Alpine Linux is a minimal Linux distribution designed to be lightweight
- The same application runs on both Ubuntu and Alpine with identical functionality
- Alpine image is about 5 times smaller, making it more suitable for production environments
- Alpine uses `sh` instead of `bash`, but provides the same core functionality
