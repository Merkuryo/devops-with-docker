## Instructions

Run the container:
```bash
docker run -it devopsdockeruh/pull_exercise
```

Navigate to Docker Hub to find the documentation for this image:
https://hub.docker.com/r/devopsdockeruh/pull_exercise/

The image README contains instructions about the password needed.

## Finding the Password

The documentation indicates that the password is "basics".

## Running the Container with Input

```bash
script -q -c 'docker run -it devopsdockeruh/pull_exercise' /dev/null << 'EOF'
basics
EOF
```

Or using echo with a pseudo-terminal:
```bash
echo "basics" | docker run -it devopsdockeruh/pull_exercise
```

## Output

```
Give me the password: basics
You found the correct password. Secret message is:
"This is the secret message"
```

## The Secret Message

**"This is the secret message"**

This exercise demonstrates how to:
- Navigate Docker Hub to find documentation
- Read README files for images
- Follow instructions provided by image creators
- Interact with containerized applications
