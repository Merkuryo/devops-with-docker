## Command to Complete the Exercise

### Create a file locally:
```bash
touch text.log
```

### Run the container with bind mount:
```bash
docker run -d -v "$(pwd)/text.log:/usr/src/app/text.log" devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:alpine
```

## Explanation

The `-v` option creates a bind mount that links a file or directory from the host machine into the container:

- `"$(pwd)/text.log"` - The source file on the host machine (current directory)
- `:/usr/src/app/text.log` - The destination path inside the container

When the container writes to `/usr/src/app/text.log`, the changes are immediately reflected in the `text.log` file on the host machine.

## Verification

After running the container, check that logs are being written:

```bash
cat text.log
```

You should see timestamps being added every 2 seconds:
```
2025-12-26 15:04:00 +0000 UTC
2025-12-26 15:04:02 +0000 UTC
2025-12-26 15:04:04 +0000 UTC
2025-12-26 15:04:06 +0000 UTC
2025-12-26 15:04:08 +0000 UTC
```

## Key Concepts

- **Bind Mount** - A way to mount a file or directory from the host into the container
- **Ephemeral Storage** - Without volumes, files created in containers are lost when the container is removed
- **-v Option** - Docker's option to create volumes or bind mounts
- **File Persistence** - Changes made inside the container to mounted files are immediately visible on the host
