## Exercise 1.13 - Hello Backend (Mandatory)

## Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM golang:1.16

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY . .

RUN go build

EXPOSE 8080

CMD ["./server"]
```

## Build Command

```bash
docker build -t backend-app .
```

## Run Command

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 backend-app
```

Or all in one:

```bash
docker build -t backend-app . && docker run -d -p 8080:8080 backend-app
```

## Testing the Application

Once the container is running, test the `/ping` endpoint:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/ping
```

Expected response: `pong`

## Explanation

The Dockerfile:

1. **FROM golang:1.16** - Uses Go 1.16 as the base image (required by the project)
2. **WORKDIR /usr/src/app** - Sets the working directory in the container
3. **COPY . .** - Copies the entire project from the host to the container
4. **RUN go build** - Compiles the Go code and generates a binary named "server"
5. **EXPOSE 8080** - Exposes port 8080 (the default port for the application)
6. **CMD ["./server"]** - Runs the compiled binary server application

## Key Points

- **golang:1.16** - Provides Go 1.16 runtime and build tools required by the project
- **go build** - Automatically generates a binary named "server" in the working directory
- **./server** - The compiled binary that starts the backend API server
- **Port 8080** - The default port for the application (configurable via PORT environment variable)
- **/ping endpoint** - Health check endpoint that returns "pong" as response

## Success Criteria Met

- ✓ Dockerfile builds successfully without errors
- ✓ Container runs with port 8080 exposed and published
- ✓ The /ping endpoint responds with "pong" at http://localhost:8080/ping
- ✓ No code modifications made to the project

## Environment Variables (for future exercises)

The server supports additional environment variables:
- `PORT` - Change the listening port (default: 8080)
- `REQUEST_ORIGIN` - CORS configuration (used in later exercises)
- `REDIS_HOST` - Redis host (used in later exercises)
- `POSTGRES_HOST`, `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, `POSTGRES_DATABASE` - Database configuration (used in later exercises)
