## Exercise 1.12 - Hello Frontend (Mandatory)

## Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM node:16

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY . .

RUN npm install && npm run build

RUN npm install -g serve

EXPOSE 5000

CMD ["serve", "-s", "-l", "5000", "build"]
```

## Build Command

```bash
docker build -t frontend-app .
```

## Run Command

```bash
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 frontend-app
```

Or all in one:

```bash
docker build -t frontend-app . && docker run -d -p 5000:5000 frontend-app
```

## Accessing the Application

Once the container is running, navigate to:
```
http://localhost:5000
```

You should see the Docker frontend application with a message confirming successful connection.

## Explanation

The Dockerfile:

1. **FROM node:16** - Uses Node.js 16 LTS (recommended by the project README)
2. **WORKDIR /usr/src/app** - Sets the working directory in the container
3. **COPY . .** - Copies the entire project from the host to the container
4. **RUN npm install && npm run build** - Installs dependencies and builds the React application into the `build` folder
5. **RUN npm install -g serve** - Installs the `serve` package globally to serve static files
6. **EXPOSE 5000** - Exposes port 5000 where the application will listen
7. **CMD ["serve", "-s", "-l", "5000", "build"]** - Runs the serve command to serve the built application

## Key Points

- **node:16** - Provides Node.js 16 LTS, which is compatible with the project
- **npm install && npm run build** - Builds the React application into static files
- **serve** - A lightweight Node.js package for serving static files
- **-s** flag - Serves any non-file requests to index.html (required for single-page apps)
- **-l 5000** - Listens on port 5000 as required by the exercise
- Port 5000 is properly exposed and published with the `-p` flag

## Success Criteria Met

- ✓ Dockerfile builds successfully without errors
- ✓ Container runs with port 5000 exposed and published
- ✓ Application responds at http://localhost:5000 with the frontend HTML
- ✓ No code modifications made to the project
