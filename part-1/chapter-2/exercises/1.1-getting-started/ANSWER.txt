# Exercise 1.1 Answer

## Commands Run

Started with three separate commands to spin up nginx containers:

```
$ docker run -d nginx
$ docker run -d nginx
$ docker run -d nginx
```

The image wasn't available locally so Docker pulled it. Got back three container IDs:
- 6db23150ab14
- 8d022b680006
- e224106e17b0

Then stopped two of them by their auto-generated names:

```
$ docker stop bold_faraday zen_greider
```

## Final Output

```
$ docker ps -a --filter ancestor=nginx
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS                      PORTS     NAMES
e224106e17b0   nginx     "/docker-entrypoint.…"   47 seconds ago       Exited (0) 20 seconds ago             bold_faraday
8d022b680006   nginx     "/docker-entrypoint.…"   59 seconds ago       Exited (0) 21 seconds ago             zen_greider
6db23150ab14   nginx     "/docker-entrypoint.…"   About a minute ago   Up About a minute           80/tcp    crazy_wing
```

The output shows exactly what was asked for - two stopped containers (bold_faraday and zen_greider) and one that's still running (crazy_wing). Pretty straightforward exercise to get familiar with starting containers and using docker ps to check their status.
