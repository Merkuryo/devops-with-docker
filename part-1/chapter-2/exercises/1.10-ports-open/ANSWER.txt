## Command to Start the Web Service

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:alpine server
```

## Alternative Commands

If you want to run it in detached mode:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:alpine server
```

Or using the image created in Exercise 1.8:
```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 web-server
```

## Accessing the Web Service

Once the container is running, you can access the service in your browser:
```
http://localhost:8080
```

Or using curl:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080
```

## Expected Output

```json
{"message":"You connected to the following path: /","path":"/"}
```

## Explanation

- **-p 8080:8080** - Maps port 8080 from the container to port 8080 on the host
  - First number: host port
  - Second number: container port
- **devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:alpine** - The base image that has a web service
- **server** - The argument that tells the image to start the web service (listening on port 8080)

## Port Mapping Concepts

- **Exposing a port** - Declaring in the Dockerfile (EXPOSE 8080) that the service listens on a port
- **Publishing a port** - Using -p flag to map host ports to container ports
- **localhost** - Special hostname referring to your local machine (same as 127.0.0.1)

## Security Note

The syntax `-p 8080:8080` opens the port to all interfaces. For more security, you can restrict to localhost only:
```bash
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service:alpine server
```

This would only allow connections from your own machine, not from the internet.
