## Exercise 1.15 - Homework (Mandatory)

### Project: Temperature Converter

A command-line temperature converter application written in Python that converts between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

### Dockerfile

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY app.py .

RUN chmod +x app.py

ENTRYPOINT ["python3", "app.py"]
```

### Building the Image

```bash
docker build -t temperature-converter .
```

### Pushing to Docker Hub

1. Tag the image with your Docker Hub username:
```bash
docker tag temperature-converter <username>/temperature-converter
```

2. Login to Docker Hub:
```bash
docker login
```

3. Push the image:
```bash
docker push <username>/temperature-converter
```

### Running the Container

Interactive mode (requires terminal):
```bash
docker run -it <username>/temperature-converter
```

Batch mode (with piped input):
```bash
echo -e "1\n25" | docker run -i <username>/temperature-converter
```

### Application Features

The application converts between:
- Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit
- Celsius ↔ Kelvin
- Fahrenheit ↔ Kelvin

### Docker Hub Repository Setup

The Docker Hub repository should include:

**Repository name:** `temperature-converter`

**Description:** 
"A simple command-line temperature converter application. Converts between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin. Supports both interactive and batch modes for easy integration."

**Instructions:**
```
Run the container:
docker run -it <username>/temperature-converter

Example:
echo -e "1\n25" | docker run -i <username>/temperature-converter
Output: 25.0°C = 77.00°F
```

### Key Points

- **Base Image:** `python:3.10-slim` - Lightweight Python image
- **Working Directory:** `/app` - Application directory in container
- **Entry Point:** Direct Python script execution
- **Port:** No ports exposed (command-line application)
- **Input:** Supports both interactive (-it flags) and piped input (-i flag)

### Success Criteria Met

- ✓ Original application created (not a fork/clone)
- ✓ Dockerfile created and tested
- ✓ Image builds successfully
- ✓ Application runs without errors in Docker
- ✓ Ready to be pushed to Docker Hub
- ✓ Documentation includes usage instructions

### Docker Hub Link

`username/temperature-converter`

Replace `username` with your Docker Hub username after pushing the image.

## Explanation

This homework exercise demonstrates:
- Creating a Dockerfile for a custom application
- Understanding image building and tagging
- Proper documentation for Docker Hub
- Publishing and sharing container images
- Making applications portable through containerization

The Temperature Converter is a simple but functional application that showcases how to containerize a Python CLI tool and make it accessible to others through Docker Hub.
