## Exercise 2.1 - Simple Service Writing to Log

### docker-compose.yaml

```yaml
services:
  simple-web-service:
    image: devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service
    container_name: simple-web-service
    volumes:
      - .:/usr/src/app
```

### Running the Service

```bash
docker compose up
```

### Checking the Logs

In another terminal:
```bash
tail -f text.log
```

Or view the complete log file:
```bash
cat text.log
```

### Expected Output

The service will write to `text.log`:
```
2025-01-15 10:23:45 Log entry 1
2025-01-15 10:23:50 Log entry 2
2025-01-15 10:23:55 Log entry 3
...
```

### Stopping the Service

```bash
docker compose down
```

### Why This Works

1. **Service Definition:** The docker-compose.yaml defines a service using the pre-built image
2. **Volume Binding:** The volume `.:/usr/src/app` maps the host current directory to the container's app directory
3. **Automatic Logging:** The service automatically writes to text.log every few seconds
4. **Persistent Storage:** Logs remain in the host filesystem even after the container stops

### Advantages of Docker Compose

- **Simplicity:** Single docker compose up command instead of complex docker run
- **Declarative:** Configuration is clear and version-controllable
- **Reproducibility:** Anyone can run the same setup
- **Multi-container:** Easy to add more services later
- **Volume Management:** Simple volume syntax

### File Structure

```
2.1-simple-service/
├── docker-compose.yaml
├── text.log (created after running)
└── README.md
```

### Verification

The exercise is complete when:
- ✓ docker-compose.yaml exists in the directory
- ✓ `docker compose up` starts the service
- ✓ text.log file is created in the host directory
- ✓ Log entries are visible in text.log
- ✓ `docker compose down` stops the service cleanly
